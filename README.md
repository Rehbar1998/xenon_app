This is springboot Application.
I used STS 4 to build this Application.
Use MySql worbench as database, java as a backend and HTML,CSS,Javascript as frintend.
To run this app First create the database in your workbench. As I created labeval as database, you can see that in application properties which under src/main/resources.
This application is work on http://localhost:8080/.
You just have to run this Maven project as the spring Boot App in STS 4.
